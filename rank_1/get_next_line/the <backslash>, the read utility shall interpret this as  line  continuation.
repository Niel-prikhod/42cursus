[1mNAME[0m
       read ‚Äî read from standard input into shell variables

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       read [1m[[22m-r[1m] [4m[22mvar[24m...

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [4mread[24m utility shall read a single logical line from standard input into one or more shell variables.

       By  default, unless the [1m-r [22moption is specified, <backslash> shall act as an escape character. An unescaped <backslash> shall preserve the literal value of the
       following character, with the exception of a <newline>.  If a <newline> follows the <backslash>, the [4mread[24m utility shall interpret this as  line  continuation.
       The  <backslash>  and  <newline>  shall  be  removed before splitting the input into fields. All other unescaped <backslash> characters shall be removed after
       splitting the input into fields.

       If standard input is a terminal device and the invoking shell is interactive, [4mread[24m shall prompt for a continuation line when it reads  an  input  line  ending
       with a <backslash> <newline>, unless the [1m-r [22moption is specified.

       The terminating <newline> (if any) shall be removed from the input and the results shall be split into fields as in the shell for the results of parameter ex‚Äê
       pansion (see [4mSection[24m [4m2.6.5[24m, [4mField[24m [4mSplitting[24m); the first field shall be assigned to the first variable [4mvar[24m, the second field to the second variable [4mvar[24m, and so
       on. If there are fewer fields than there are [4mvar[24m operands, the remaining [4mvar[24ms shall be set to empty strings. If there are fewer [4mvar[24ms than fields, the last [4mvar[0m
       shall be set to a value comprising the following elements:

        *  The field that corresponds to the last [4mvar[24m in the normal assignment sequence described above

        *  The delimiter(s) that follow the field corresponding to the last [4mvar[0m

        *  The remaining fields and their delimiters, with trailing [4mIFS[24m white space ignored

       The  setting  of  variables specified by the [4mvar[24m operands shall affect the current shell execution environment; see [4mSection[24m [4m2.12[24m, [4mShell[24m [4mExecution[24m [4mEnvironment[24m.
       If it is called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it shall not affect the shell variables in the caller's environment.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The [4mread[24m utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, [4mSection[24m [4m12.2[24m, [4mUtility[24m [4mSyntax[24m [4mGuidelines[24m.

       The following option is supported:

       [1m-r        [22mDo not treat a <backslash> character in any special way. Consider each <backslash> to be part of the input line.

[1mOPERANDS[0m
       The following operand shall be supported:

       [4mvar[24m       The name of an existing or nonexisting shell variable.

[1mSTDIN[0m
       The standard input shall be a text file.

[1mINPUT FILES[0m
       None.

[1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES[0m
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of [4mread[24m:

       [4mIFS[24m       Determine the internal field separators used to delimit fields; see [4mSection[24m [4m2.5.3[24m, [4mShell[24m [4mVariables[24m.

       [4mLANG[24m      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‚Äê2017,  [4mSection[0m
                 [4m8.2[24m, [4mInternationalization[24m [4mVariables[24m for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       [4mLC_ALL[24m    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       [4mLC_CTYPE[24m  Determine  the  locale  for  the  interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       [4mLC_MESSAGES[0m
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       [4mNLSPATH[24m   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of [4mLC_MESSAGES[24m.

       [4mPS2[24m       Provide the prompt string that an interactive shell shall write to standard error when a line ending with a <backslash> <newline> is read and the [1m-r[0m
                 option was not specified.

[1mASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS[0m
       Default.

[1mSTDOUT[0m

[1mOUTPUT FILES[0m
       None.

[1mEXTENDED DESCRIPTION[0m
       None.

[1mEXIT STATUS[0m
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    End-of-file was detected or an error occurred.

[1mCONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS[0m
       Default.

[1mAPPLICATION USAGE[0m
       The [1m-r [22moption is included to enable [4mread[24m to subsume the purpose of the [4mline[24m utility, which is not included in POSIX.1‚Äê2008.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       The following command:

           while read -r xx yy
           do
               printf "%s %s\n$yy$xx"
           done < [4minput_file[0m

       prints a file with the first field of each line moved to the end of the line.

[1mRATIONALE[0m
       The [4mread[24m utility historically has been a shell built-in. It was separated off into its own utility to take advantage of the richer description of  functional‚Äê
       ity introduced by this volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017.

       Since  [4mread[24m  affects  the current shell execution environment, it is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate
       utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it does not affect the shell variables in the environment of the caller.

       Although the standard input is required to be a text file, and therefore will always end with a <newline> (unless it is an empty file), the processing of con‚Äê
       tinuation lines when the [1m-r [22moption is not used can result in the input not ending with a <newline>.  This occurs if the last line of the input file ends  with
       a  <backslash>  <newline>.  It is for this reason that ‚Äò‚Äòif any'' is used in ‚Äò‚ÄòThe terminating <newline> (if any) shall be removed from the input'' in the de‚Äê
       scription.  It is not a relaxation of the requirement for standard input to be a text file.

[1mFUTURE DIRECTIONS[0m
       None.
